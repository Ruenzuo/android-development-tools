Android development tools repository
====================================

__Getting started:__

> First, install the Android SDK (I recommend to start fresh with Android Studio, even if it's still on developer preview). Probably the first reading you should be doing is design guide, even if you're not a designer. It contains the main user interface patterns that your applications should follow. Once you get all the basics of Android user experience, you can start coding with the tutorials provided by the Getting Started section of Android Development Training.

__Intermediate:__

> Moving forward to an begginer/intermediate level, I highly recommend Lars Vogel blog. All basic concepts are explained with clear code examples. Then you should explore third party frameworks that help you to get over the much hated Android fragmentation, the ones I recommend are Android Support Library by Google, ActionBarSherlock and ViewPagerIndicator by Jake Wharton. Another recommended lecture would be Best Practices for User Experience & UI, which has very nice examples of how to implement the most common Android UI patterns. Finally, starting with more intermediate/advanced stuff you should read Virgil Dobjanschi's Android restful pattern implementation, as this is the way that your application should be using web services, networking and so.

__Advanced:__

> I can't consider myself an expert Android developer, so this section probably would be an intermediate for most of the Android developers out there. Cyril Mottier blog helped me a lot to learn about the best tools and techniques on Android development. Third party frameworks like Roboguice and Roboelectric really helps you a lot with unit testing. Robospice is my networking framework, it's really similar to Dobjanschi's implementation, but in some ways I find this one more natural to the Android system. Guava is a very solid Java core library, I'm using this a lot for concurrency programming. Gradle is the best build system I have used, it's superior to Maven and Ant and it's been chosen by the Android development team as the next Android build system. Finally, iOS developers are always proud about the Apple's iOS Simulator, and Android developers have been doomed with Google's Android Emulator for a lot of time, but no more! Simulation, at least sort of..., is also available on Android with this tool, enjoy.
